# Duplication (PCR duplicates expected)
duplication:
  acceptable: 20
  warning: 35
  critical: 50
  check_duplicates: true  # Should check and remove

# Coverage expectations
coverage:
  min_coverage: 10

notes: |
  WGS characteristics:
  - Uniform coverage expected across genome
  - PCR duplicates should be marked/removed
  - Standard quality thresholds apply
  - Important for variant calling accuracy
