# ChIP Sequencing QC Profile

name: "ChIP Sequencing"
abbrev: "chipseq"
description: "Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing"

# GC content (ChIP-seq enriches GC-rich promoters/open chromatin)
gc_content:
  mean: 55.0
  range: [45, 65]
  tolerance: 5.0
  note: "Enriched regions (promoters, CpG islands) are highly GC-rich (~55-65%)"

# Quality expectations
quality:
  q20_threshold: 0.80
  q28_threshold: 0.80
  q30_threshold: 0.75
  mean_quality_min: 28

# Duplication (depends on IP efficiency)
duplication:
  acceptable: 30   # Higher than WGS
  warning: 50
  critical: 70
  check_duplicates: true
  note: "Duplication depends on IP enrichment and library complexity"

# Coverage expectations (enriched regions)
coverage:
  min_coverage: 10
  target_coverage: 20
  high_coverage: 100

# Adapter removal
adapters:
  required: true
  acceptable: 5
  warning: 10
  critical: 15

# Special considerations
special:
  expect_enrichment: true
  nonuniform_coverage_expected: true
  check_library_complexity: true

notes: |
  ChIP-seq characteristics:
  - Moderate duplication acceptable (enrichment at peaks)
  - Library complexity important (measure with PCR bottleneck coefficient)
  - Non-uniform coverage expected (signal at binding sites)
  - Control/Input sample critical for analysis
