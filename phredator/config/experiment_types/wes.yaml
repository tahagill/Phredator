# Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) QC Profile

name: "Whole Exome Sequencing"
abbrev: "wes"
description: "Targeted sequencing of protein-coding regions"

# GC content (Exons are slightly GC-richer than genome)
gc_content:
  mean: 45.0
  range: [40, 55]
  tolerance: 4.0
  note: "Coding exons are GC-richer than genome average (~45% vs ~41%)"

# Quality expectations
quality:
  q20_threshold: 0.85  # Slightly higher for targeted
  q28_threshold: 0.80
  q30_threshold: 0.75
  mean_quality_min: 30

# Duplication (higher than WGS due to targeting)
duplication:
  acceptable: 30
  warning: 45
  critical: 60
  check_duplicates: true

# Coverage expectations (targeted, higher coverage)
coverage:
  min_coverage: 20
  target_coverage: 100
  high_coverage: 200

# Adapter removal
adapters:
  required: true
  acceptable: 5
  warning: 10
  critical: 15

# Special considerations
special:
  targeted_sequencing: true
  expect_nonuniform_coverage: true
  off_target_acceptable: 20  # % reads off target

notes: |
  WES characteristics:
  - Higher duplication than WGS (limited target space)
  - Very high coverage of exons required
  - Off-target reads expected (~20%)
  - Capture efficiency important metric
