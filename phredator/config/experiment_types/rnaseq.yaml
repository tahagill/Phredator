# RNA Sequencing QC Profile

name: "RNA Sequencing"
abbrev: "rnaseq"
description: "Transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq, total RNA-seq)"

# GC content (RNA-seq is GC-richer than genomic DNA)
gc_content:
  mean: 52.0
  range: [45, 60]
  tolerance: 4.0
  note: "mRNA/transcripts are GC-richer than genome (~50% vs ~41% in human)"

# Quality expectations
quality:
  q20_threshold: 0.80
  q28_threshold: 0.80
  q30_threshold: 0.75
  mean_quality_min: 28

# Duplication (HIGH duplication is NORMAL for RNA-seq!)
duplication:
  acceptable: 60   # Much higher than DNA-seq
  warning: 75
  critical: 85
  check_duplicates: false  # Do NOT remove for RNA-seq!
  note: "High duplication expected due to highly expressed genes"

# Coverage expectations (non-uniform expected)
coverage:
  min_coverage: 1
  target_coverage: 20
  high_coverage: 1000  # Highly expressed genes

# Adapter removal
adapters:
  required: true
  acceptable: 5
  warning: 10
  critical: 15

# Special considerations
special:
  allow_high_duplication: true
  expect_nonuniform_coverage: true
  check_strand_specificity: true
  check_rrna_contamination: true

notes: |
  RNA-seq characteristics:
  - High duplication is NORMAL (abundant transcripts)
  - DO NOT remove duplicates (they're real biological signal)
  - Non-uniform coverage expected (gene expression varies)
  - rRNA contamination is common issue
  - Strand-specific protocols preferred
