# Metagenomics QC Profile

name: "Metagenomics"
abbrev: "metagenomics"
description: "Community genomics / microbiome sequencing"

# Quality expectations
quality:
  q20_threshold: 0.80
  q28_threshold: 0.75
  q30_threshold: 0.70
  mean_quality_min: 25

# Duplication (variable across species)
duplication:
  acceptable: 40   # More tolerant
  warning: 60
  critical: 75
  check_duplicates: true

# GC content (highly variable!)
gc_content:
  check: false  # Don't check - multiple organisms
  note: "GC content varies widely across organisms in community"

# Adapter removal
adapters:
  required: true
  acceptable: 5
  warning: 10
  critical: 15

# Special considerations
special:
  multiple_organisms: true
  variable_gc_content: true
  check_host_contamination: true
  expect_high_diversity: true

notes: |
  Metagenomics characteristics:
  - Multiple organisms = variable GC content
  - Don't apply single-organism GC thresholds
  - Host contamination (e.g., human DNA) is common
  - Diversity metrics important
  - Quality slightly less critical than single-organism studies
