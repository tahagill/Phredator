# E. coli QC Profile
# Based on K-12 MG1655 reference

name: "Escherichia coli"
strain: "K-12 MG1655"
description: "QC thresholds for E. coli bacterial sequencing"

# GC content expectations
gc_content:
  mean: 50.8
  range: [49, 52]
  tolerance: 1.5  # Tighter tolerance for bacteria

# Quality score thresholds
quality:
  q20_threshold: 0.85  # Higher standards for bacteria
  q28_threshold: 0.80
  q30_threshold: 0.75
  mean_quality_min: 30

# Duplication levels (bacteria have less duplication)
duplication:
  acceptable: 5    # Much lower than eukaryotes
  warning: 15
  critical: 30
  
# Adapter contamination
adapters:
  acceptable: 5
  warning: 10
  critical: 15

# N content
n_content:
  max_per_base: 2  # Stricter for small genome
  max_total: 0.5

# Overrepresented sequences
overrepresented:
  max_count: 3
  max_percentage: 0.5

# Read length expectations
read_length:
  min: 50
  typical: [150, 250]  # Longer reads better for small genomes
  
notes: |
  E. coli genome:
  - Size: 4.6 Mbp (much smaller than mammals)
  - GC: 50.8% (very uniform)
  - Circular chromosome
  - High coverage possible with fewer reads
  - Lower duplication expected due to genome size
