  range: [39, 44]
  tolerance: 3.0

# Quality score thresholds
quality:
  q20_threshold: 0.80
  q28_threshold: 0.80
  q30_threshold: 0.75
  mean_quality_min: 28

# Duplication levels

  warning: 35
  critical: 50
  
# Adapter contamination
adapters:
  acceptable: 5
  warning: 10

# N content
n_content:
  max_per_base: 5
  max_total: 1

notes: |
  Mouse genome GC content (~42%) is very similar to human.
  Laboratory mice are inbred, expect low heterozygosity.
