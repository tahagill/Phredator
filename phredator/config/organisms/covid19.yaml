name: "SARS-CoV-2"
assembly: "NC_045512.2"
description: "QC thresholds for COVID-19 viral genome sequencing"

# GC content expectations
gc_content:
  mean: 38.0
  range: [36, 40]
  tolerance: 2.0

# Quality score thresholds (stricter for viral surveillance)
quality:
  q20_threshold: 0.90  # Very high quality needed
  q28_threshold: 0.85
  q30_threshold: 0.80
  mean_quality_min: 30

# Duplication levels (amplicon sequencing has high duplication)
duplication:
  acceptable: 50   # Much higher tolerance for amplicon
  warning: 70
  critical: 85
  
# Adapter contamination
adapters:
  acceptable: 5
  warning: 10
  critical: 15

# N content (critical for variant calling)
n_content:
  max_per_base: 1   # Very strict
  max_total: 0.1

# Overrepresented sequences (amplicon primers expected)
overrepresented:
  max_count: 20     # Primers expected
  max_percentage: 5.0

# Read length expectations
read_length:
  min: 75
  typical: [150, 250]  # Amplicon sequencing
  
notes: |
  SARS-CoV-2 genome:
  - Size: 29.9 kb (very small)
  - Single-stranded RNA virus
  - GC: 38%
  - Usually sequenced with amplicon methods (ARTIC, etc.)
  - High duplication expected and acceptable
  - Requires very high quality for variant detection
  - Clinical surveillance use case
